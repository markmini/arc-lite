                <h3>IMPORTANCE OF FARM LAYOUT DESIGN</h3>
                   <p> One of the importance of farm layout designing is that not only does a well-planned and organized farm have fewer pest problems, 
                       CHEAPER to run particularly in the long term. The cost of running a farm is one of the key factors in a farming business.<br>
                   </p> 
    
                       <ul>BENEFITS OF DESIGNING A FARM LAYOUT<br>
                         In farmland management, a farmland plan can be an incredibly valuable living tool/document for a farming business. 
                         one may ask; What are the benefits of farm layout design Below? Below, are some of the benefits of developing a farm plan (layout).
                    <li> It helps determine or verify the actual land size and/ or land coordinates </li> 
                    <li> It also helps allocate/ arrange farmstead and farm activities in an orderly and right orientation</li>
                    <li> It helps with the optimum use of the land and knowing future farmland units for possible expansion</li>
                    <li> It promotes organized farming and neatness of the farm</li> 
                    <li> It may also help you understand the topography of the area and soil type</li> 
                      </ul> 
                    <br>
                       <p>We also help you produce contour lines of the land
                        Helps farmers project their yields and maximize land use to avoid land wastage
                        Improve your overall farm management and provide a plan that guides the direction of a profitable and sustainable busines
                        It helps bring together your business strengths and weaknesses with the strengths and weaknesses of the environment you a

                        Understanding the topography of the farmland will be a premise for deciding on the kind of drainage system best suitable 
                        It also helps in determining the irrigation system to be adopted.

                 It delivers water and nutrients directly to the plant's root zone, in the right amounts, 
                 at the right time, so each plant gets exactly what it needs, when it needs it, to grow optimally.

      <h2>AQUAPONICS FARMING</h2>
         <h2>What is Aquaponic farming?</h2>
            <p>Aquaponics is a blend of hydroponics (growing plants in water) and aquaculture (raising fish). Simply put, it’s the growing of plants and rearing of fish in the same space.
               This system can be customized to fit any kind of space; from that small space in your backyard to a greenhouse.
            </p>

      </div>

      <p>Aquaponics presents an integrated farming system whereby; waste from fish is used as fertilizer for plants and plants purify the water by removing the nutrients increasing oxygen concentration.
          Waste from fish contains nutrient which are essential for plant growth.
          The setup of the fish and plants represent a closed system such that;
          Water containing waste from the fish is pumped to the plants.
          Plants absorb nutrients from the water, in the process cleaning the water which is then pumped back to the fish.</p>

        <h2>BEST FARMER PRACTICE</h2>
        <h2>Intercropping</h2>
        <p>
          Intercropping is the practice of growing two or more crops with the goal of producing a greater yield on a given piece of lan
          The farmers grows several species in between each other during the same season hence utilizing the resources that would other
          not be utilized by a single crop.
          One example is growing maize and beans on one peace of land.

             As a farming practice, intercropping is efficient and can produce high yield when implemented correctly.

            <h2>Major benefits of intercropping</h2>
            <li>Increased Profit because secondary crops provide more returns and ensure profit when the primary crop fails.
            <li>Improved Weed Management because beneficial plants and not weeds, occupy vacant spaces in between rolls.
            <li>Reduction of Fertilizer Application.
                  As a result of intercropping with nitrogen fixing legumes, the soil becomes fertile therefore the reduction of the need for
                  synthesized fertilizers.
            <li>Pest Management as secondary or companion plants can be used to attract natural enemies of the primary crop.</li>
